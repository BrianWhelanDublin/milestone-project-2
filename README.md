# Great Escapes, G-Travel

## Milestone Project 2

- The aim of this project is to build an interactive front end website using HTML CSS and javaScript. 
- I have decided to build a website for a fictional travel company G-Travel. I have used the knowledge I've learned in the course to date as well as good good user experience to create a responsive, well designed functional website.
