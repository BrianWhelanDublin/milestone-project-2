# Great Escapes, G-Travel

## Design 

#### Colour Scheme
I've created a dark theme for this website using a dark russian black #181822 as my main background colour. My text is an off white #fafafb to contrast against the dark background. 
I have alternated the colours on hover effects too to show the user what elements are clickable.

#### Typography
I've used one font in different weights for headings and text element across the site to creat a uniform theme throughout all the text.
Ive imported the Mulish font to my css stylesheet from Google Fonts.
I used sans-serif as a fall-back font in case for any reason my fonts were not imported.

#### Imagery
Imagery was very important to me and I choose images that conveyed the feel of the company thoroughout I tried to choose images of well known landmarks for each destination also. 
I used images as backgrounds to help seperate sections and placed slightly opaque elements overthem. This also helped to soften the dark background.
I sourced all my images from unsplash.

#### Icons
I used lineawsome for icons for social media links which I've included in the footer.
