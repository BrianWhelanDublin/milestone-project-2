# Great Escapes, G-Travel

## Milestone Project 2

- The aim of this project is to build an interactive front end website using HTML CSS and javaScript.
- I have decided to build a website for a fictional travel company G-Travel. I have used the knowledge I've learned in the course to date as well as good good user experience to create a responsive, well designed functional website.
- My web page consists of:
  - A landing page containing the company information, all the destinations the company travels to, customer reviews, special offers, newsletter sign up and a simple contact form and contact details. My footer contains the social media links.
  - Each destination then fills out the destination page with a title section, information about the destination, a map with search capabilities for local attractions and destination packages section.
  - They packages then lead to a booking enquiry form which can be filled out and sent to make a booking enquiry.

## Design

#### Colour Scheme

- I've created a dark theme for this website using a dark russian black #181822 as my main background colour. My text is an off white #fafafb to contrast against the dark background.
  I have alternated the colours on hover effects too to show the user what elements are clickable.
   - ![Image of colour scheme](assets/images/readme/design/colour-scheme.png)

#### Typography

- I've used one font in different weights for headings and text element across the site to create a uniform theme throughout all the text.
  I,ve imported the Mulish font to my css stylesheet from Google Fonts.
  I used sans-serif as a fall-back font in case for any reason my fonts were not imported.
   - - ![Image of google font](assets/images/readme/design/font.png)

#### Imagery

- Imagery was very important to me and I choose images that conveyed the feel of the company throughout. I tried to choose images of well known landmarks for each destination also.
  I used images as backgrounds to help separate sections and placed a slightly opaque element over them to conatain the text. This also helped to soften the dark background.
  I sourced all my images from unsplash.

#### Icons

- I used line awesome for icons for social media links which I've included in the footer. I've also used arrows on some links to help draw attention to them and to show the user they are clickable.


## Features

### Landing Page Features.

 -  #### navbar
   - With the help of Code and Create youtube tutorial (details in the credit section) I have created a hamburger menu. The navbar appears on click of the hamburger and then dissapears on a click of the x. The navbar also disapears when you click an option in the list. The list items background colour and text colour also change on hover.
     - To Open navbar

     - Nav item hover
       - ![Image of navbar hover](assets/images/readme/features/navbar-hover.png)

  - #### Destination Sliders
    - Using lightslider (details in technologies used section) I have created two lists of destinations. One city destinations and two beach destinations. The destination details are pulled from a javascript array od destination objects I have created. To add new destinations in the future or to change destination details you simply have to edit the perticular object in the array.
      - City Destinations
        - ![Image of city destination slider](assets/images/readme/features/citydestinations.png)

        - ![Image of beach destination slider](assets/images/readme/features/beachdestinations.png)

  - #### Reviews 
    - The reviews section features 3 reviews by different customers. On page opening one review is shown with the customers name who wrote the review highlighted with a box shadow to show the user the review was written by them. On click of the next person their review will then be shown and their name highlighted. I have also added directional arrows to encourage users to click.

### 404 Error Page

 - #### 404 error page. 
   - I've also included a 404 error page with github pages if the user navigates to a wrong url for whatever reason. To do this I did the following:
     1. I first located and clicked the add file button in github.
       -  ![Image of add file button](assets/images/readme/features/new-file.png)
     2. Git hub then asks you to name your file.
       - ![Image of name your file input](assets/images/readme/features/name-file.png)
     3.  I then named my file 404.html.
       - ![Image of file named 404.html](assets/images/readme/features/file-404.png)
     4. Once these steps were complete then commit the file to your master branch in the project repository with a commit message.
       ![Image of message commit](assets/images/readme/features/commit-404.png)

### Features left to Implement.

  - In the future I could expand on the website adding a booking feature to book packages directly from the website instead of just enquiring about them.
  - The feature to book flights could also be added.
  - The feature to book different hotels at each destination could be added too.



## Technologies used

### Languages Used.

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

  - HTML5 was used to create the content and base of each page.

- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

  - CSS3 was used to then style the page and make it responive through media querys, and interactive through using css transitions.

- [javaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
  - javaScript was used throughout the website to make the site interactive. The javaScript will change what is being shown to the user depending on what they click.

### Frameworks Libraries and Programs.

- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  - I used bootstrap throughout the site to make it responsive. I also used bootstrap to create the booking forms, and the modals pop up when the forms have been submited.

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

  - I imported the Mulish font from google fonts and used it consistently across the site.

- [Line awesome](https://icons8.com/line-awesome)

  - I used different icons from Line awesome throughout the site for social media links and for some back links to improve user experience.

- [Lightsilder](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightslider/)

  - I used Lightslider to create the responsive destinations slider on my home page.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

  - Git was used as a version control in the terminal.

- [Github](https://github.com/)

  - Github was used to create and store the project repository.

- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

  - Gitpod was used to create my files and code the project.

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

  - Balsamiq was used to create Wireframes for the project during the initial planning stage.

- [Am I responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)

  - Am i responsive was used to take screenshots of the page at different screen sizes.

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
  - jQuery was used for the Rest Countries Api call and for the Lightslider.

### Application Programming Interface (Api's)

- [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.eu/)

  - I used the Rest Countries Api on my destination page to get details for each destination. I used the data for the countrymap, its capital, region, language and currency and rendered it to the page for each different destination.

- [Google Maps Api](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform)

  - I used the google maps api to render a map for each destination on the destination page. I set each destinations coordinates and zoom in the destination object which then tailored the map for each destination.

- [Google maps Places Library](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places/)

  - I used the Google Maps places library to do a nearby search of popular attractions for each destination. The user can choose from a list of attractions and they will be shown on the map.

- [Marker Cluster Plus](https://github.com/googlemaps/js-markerclustererplus)

  - I used the Marker Cluster Plus library from Google Maps to place cluster markers on each map. This keeps the map less cluttered when performing a search but lets the user know there is a number of places in a specific area.

- [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
  - EmailJS was used for all forms including the contact form and the booking enquiry form. The newsletter form will also send an attomatic reply to thank the user for signing up.
